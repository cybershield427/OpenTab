After last time when the frame of the application has been created, there are couple new progresses were made.

2. The new window after login button was clicked have been created to take the username and password
3. create the database to hold the users' information such as username, password, first last name, phone number
4. The user login credential has been implemented that will check if username, password pair is in the database
5. The windows after login have been created. If it's admin(manager/owner), it will give the window to sign up for new
    user (more function such as delete will be added later on). If it's a normal user, then the main window will display.
6. Sign up window has been implemented which have field to take user input. It will check if the username has been taken
    and password met the security requirement (length, complexity). If all good, new user will be added into the database.
    If not, then an error message will be display accordingly.
7. Created restaurant database to hold customer information such as name, credit card number and table number
8. Created authorized users: waiter1 & waiter2
